# 🌍 BioVision: Virtual Simulator for Plastic Bottle Detection  

We’ve developed an **interactive virtual simulator** for our **Plastic Bottle Detector**, allowing you to test the system in real time using your **webcam** or by uploading an image. As you interact with the simulator, you can **detect plastic bottles**, track your detections, and measure the total amount of plastic you’ve "recycled." 🚀  

**Try it out and see how much plastic you can collect!** ♻️

## 📌 Installation & Setup  

Ensure you have **Python 3.8 or later** installed and added to the system path.  

1️⃣ **Install the required dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics
```
2️⃣ **Run the simulator:**  
```bash
python GUI3.0.py
```

## 🔑 Login & Registration  
Before using the simulator, you’ll need to **log in or register** to start detecting plastic bottles. This will allow you to track your recycled plastic score over time.

## 🎮 Detection Modes  
Choose between two detection modes:  

- **📷 Image Mode**: Upload an image, and the system will detect plastic bottles within it.  
- **🎥 Live Camera Mode**: Use your webcam for real-time plastic bottle detection.

## ♻️ Waste Collection & Recycling Score  
Every plastic bottle detected is **added to your recycling score**, allowing you to track how much plastic you've "recycled" while using the simulator.  

🌱 **Challenge yourself to collect as much plastic as possible and make a difference!**
