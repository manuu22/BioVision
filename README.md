# 🌍 BioVision: Virtual Simulator for Plastic Bottle Detection  

We’ve developed an **interactive virtual simulator** for our **Plastic Bottle Detector**, allowing you to test the system in real time using your **webcam** or by uploading an image. As you interact with the simulator, you can **detect plastic bottles**, track your detections, and measure the total amount of plastic you’ve "recycled." 🚀  

**Try it out and see how much plastic you can collect!** ♻️

## ♻️ Waste Collection & Recycling Score  
Every plastic bottle detected is **added to your recycling score**, allowing you to track how much plastic you've "recycled" while using the simulator.  

🌱 **Challenge yourself to collect as much plastic as possible and make a difference!**
